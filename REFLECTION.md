### CS 81 Module 4A Review Tracker, by GregH, 7/8/25

#### What was the most helpful aspect of this codeâ€™s structure? 

Every task was contained in a separate function, making it easy to see each task distinctly, to understand what each section of code did, and how to add code to accomplish desired tasks.

#### What part was confusing or took longer to understand?

I got hung up on the fact that if two or more books are tied for the most number of times read, the mostReadBook() function only returns one of them. It's a design issue, not a coding issue.
