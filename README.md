#### CS 81 Module 4A Review Tracker, by GregH, 7/8/25

readingTracker.js has functions and example function calls to track how much time was spent reading various books each day and to analyze the resulting data. I added code comments to explain how the code works and suggest an improvement, and I added a test case in the code (adding a log entry). In REFLECTION.md, I answer two questions from the assignment instructions.
